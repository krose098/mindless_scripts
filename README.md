# Mindless Scripts

A collection of miscellaneous tools and scripts that I use to make my life easier. Nothing fancy, just practical utilities that solve everyday problems.

## What's in here?

This repo is basically my digital toolbox - a bunch of scripts I've written over time to automate annoying tasks, process data, or just make things work the way I want them to. Most of these started as quick one-offs that turned out to be useful enough to keep around.

## Setup

This repo is set up as a uv project, so it's fairly self-contained in terms of relevant packages and dependencies. Just run `uv sync` to get everything you need.

## Usage

Each script should be pretty self-contained. Check the individual files for any specific requirements or usage instructions. Most are designed to be run from the command line or imported where needed.

## Philosophy

These scripts follow the "good enough" principle - they're not meant to be perfect or handle every edge case, just solve the specific problems I run into. If you find them useful, great! If not, no worries.

## Contributing

Feel free to suggest improvements or report issues, but keep in mind this is primarily my personal collection of utilities. I'm not aiming for enterprise-grade software here - just stuff that works for me.

## License

Use at your own risk. Most of this is probably too specific to my workflow to be broadly useful anyway.
